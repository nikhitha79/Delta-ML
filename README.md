# Delta-ML
We leverage the capabilities of the Delta-ML model to predict relevant TADF properties using a lower cost baseline method PPP to obtain comparable accuracy to the QM method ADC(2).

- The model can be trained using the code provided in schnet.py
- The datasets used for this study are given as Dataset-I.csv (rationally designed molecules) and Dataset-II.csv (substituted azaphenalenes)
- XYZ coordinates of both the dataset are given as zip files
